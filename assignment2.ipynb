        "**Q1.** Open the \"tidy_data.pdf\" document in the repo, which is a paper called Tidy Data by Hadley Wickham.\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  This paper is about the concept of data tidying. It defines a framework for tidy data and addresses why tidy datasets are important. Additionally, the paper will provide a case study to demonstrate the benefits of the framework.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
        "\n",
        "  The \"tidy data standard\" was created to help make analyzing data more efficient. With the tidy data standard the process of creating data analysis tools is simplified. This enables the analyst to focus on the actaul problem at hand instead of worrying about how the data is organized.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What\n",
        "   does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, itâ€™s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  The first sentence means that tidy datasets share a common structure, the way it links its physical layout with its semantics, which is much like how families have a common organization. Messy datasets can be messy in a variety of ways and could require different tecniques to make them tidy, similar to how families have their unique dynamics. The second sentence means that when looking at a specific dataset it is often easy to identify the units (observations) and tha characteristics/attributes of those units (variables), but defining what constitutes a variable or observation acorss all datasets is more difficult because there are so many different types of data and contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Values are defined as the individual pieces of informaiton that are collected. Variables and observations are how the values are organized. Variables organize values by their underlying attributes and are across units. Observations are all the values for the same unit.\n",
        "\n",
        "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Tidy data is defined in terms of values, variables, and observations. In a tidy dataset, columns are formed by variables, rows are formed by observations, and each type of observational unit forms a table.\n",
        "\n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
        "\n",
        "  The 5 most common problems with messy datsets are: values as column headers instead of variables names, including multiple variables within a single column, storing variables in both rows and columns, including various types of observational units within a single table, and storing a single observational unit across multiple tables. The data in Table 4 is messy because the column headers are values instead of variable names. In Table 4, variables also form both the rows and columns instead of the rows being formed by observations. Melting a dataset is a process used to tidy datasets. It is when the columns are turned into rows. To accomplish this a specific list of columns that are already variables is specified and the remaining columns are transformed into two new variables called column and value. The column variable contains the repeated column headers and the value variable contains the data values that were originially stored in separate columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Table 11 is messy because variables are stored in both the rows and columns. Tmax and tmin should both be variables for this dataset but are instead listed as values. The dates should also be values but in Table 11, the days of the month are used as column headers instead of using variable names as column headers. Table 12 is tidy and molten because each rows represents the measures for a single day (one unit) and the measured varibles have been converted into columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
        "\n",
        "  The chicken and egg problem with tidy data stems from the interdependnecy between tidy data and the tools designed to work with it. The usefullness of tidy data is dependent upon the availability of tools that can work with it. But the development of tidy tools  requires tidy data. This creates the chicken and egg situations which could lead to improvements being constrained. Wickham hopes that in the furure both statistical and congnitive factors are considered when designing tools. He hopes that a better understanding of the conginitive side of data analysis will lead to improved tools in the future.\n",
